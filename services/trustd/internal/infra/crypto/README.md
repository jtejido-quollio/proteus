# Crypto & Canonicalization (Phase 1)

Phase 0 placeholder for:
- Text canonicalization (CRLF -> LF)
- JSON canonicalization (RFC 8785 JCS)
- Ed25519 signing + verification
- Leaf hash computation
- Merkle tree + STH issuance

Implementations should live under this package and be used via `usecase.CryptoService`.
